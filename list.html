        <p>this <small>is a pen</small></p><p><small>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,</small> known as Bangabandhu, is the 'Greatest Bengali of All Time'. He was born in a respectable Muslim family on 17 March, 1920, at Tungipara village under the Gopalganj district. He started his student life at Gimadanga Primary School at the age of seven. He passed the entrance examination from this school and got admitted to the Kolkata Islamia College. Then he took admission into Dhaka University and founded the Muslim Students League. He was one of the front-line leaders of the Language Movement and was arrested on March 11, 1948. In 1970, he was re-elected President of Awami League. Under his leadership, Awami League took part in the General Election of 1970 and gained absolute majority. On March 7, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed a mammoth public rally at the Race Course ground. On the fierce night of March 25, the Pakistani Army cracked down on the innocent unarmed Bangalees, and arrested Sheikh Mujib. All the Bangalees, jumped into a bloody battle against the occupation forces. On December 16, 1971, Bangladesh became a free nation and Bangabandhu was freed from the Pakistani jail on January 8, 1972 and returned to his beloved country on January 10. It is a matter of regret that, Bangabandhu, the founding father of the nation, was killed by a group of wayward army officers.</p>
